/*
 Input Pullup Serial
 
 This example demonstrates the use of pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP). It reads a 
 digital input on pin 2 and prints the results to the serial monitor.
 
 The circuit: 
 * Momentary switch attached from pin 2 to ground 
 
 Unlike pinMode(INPUT), there is no pull-down resistor necessary. An internal 
 20K-ohm resistor is pulled to 5V. This configuration causes the input to 
 read HIGH when the switch is open, and LOW when it is closed.
