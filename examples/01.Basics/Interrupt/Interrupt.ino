/*
  Interrupt
  Use a pushbutton to control an LED; powered by interrupts.

  This sample uses an interrupt service routine (ISR) named `blink` to toggle
  a global state variable and then uses the built-in LED to display the value
  of the cached state to the user. The work of updating the cached state happens
  asynchronously in the interrupt service routine.

  This sample can easily be modified from behaving as a button into behaving as
  a switch, by changing the interrupt mode from CHANGE to LOW. Furthermore, this
  example can be modified to update the built-in LED from inside in the ISR,
  which would allow the loop function to be empty yet still allow actions and
  reactions to occur.

  This example code is in the public domain (adapted from
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/attachInterrupt).
