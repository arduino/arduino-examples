/*
  JoystickMouseControl

 Controls the mouse from a joystick on an Arduino Leonardo, Micro or Due.
 Uses a pushbutton to turn on and off mouse control, and
 a second pushbutton to click the left mouse button

 Hardware:
 * 2-axis joystick connected to pins A0 and A1
 * pushbuttons connected to pin D2 and D3

 The mouse movement is always relative. This sketch reads
 two analog inputs that range from 0 to 1023 (or less on either end)
 and translates them into ranges of -6 to 6.
 The sketch assumes that the joystick resting values are around the
 middle of the range, but that they vary within a threshold.

 WARNING:  When you use the Mouse.move() command, the Arduino takes
 over your mouse!  Make sure you have control before you use the command.
 This sketch includes a pushbutton to toggle the mouse control state, so
 you can turn on and off mouse control.
