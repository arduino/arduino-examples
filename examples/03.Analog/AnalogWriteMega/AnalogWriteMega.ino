/*
  Mega analogWrite() test

  This sketch fades LEDs up and down one at a time on digital pins 2 through 13.
  This sketch was written for the Arduino Mega, and will not work on other boards.

  The circuit:
  - LEDs attached from pins 2 through 13 to ground.

// These constants won't change.  They're used to give names
// to the pins used:
const int lowestPin = 2;
const int highestPin = 13;


void setup() {
  // set pins 2 through 13 as outputs:
  for (int thisPin = lowestPin; thisPin <= highestPin; thisPin++) {
    pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // iterate over the pins:
  for (int thisPin = lowestPin; thisPin <= highestPin; thisPin++) {
    // fade the LED on thisPin from off to brightest:
    for (int brightness = 0; brightness < 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(thisPin, brightness);
      delay(2);
    }
    // fade the LED on thisPin from brightest to off:

      analogWrite(thisPin, brightness);
      delay(2);
    }
    // pause between LEDs:
    delay(100);
